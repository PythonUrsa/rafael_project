# Roadmap

## Increase e2e test coverages
- More e2e tests on directives
- More browsers testing

## Support AngularJS v1.3
Working towards supporting AngularJS 1.3. However, due to the mass amount of breaking
changes between v1.2 and v1.3, we are working on cleaning up this project by removing
all 3rd party dependencies before supporting v1.3

## Reduce/Remove 3rd party dependencies
jQuery, jQuery UI, and underscore string should be removed as dependencies

### v0.5.0
- Convert Jade to HTML and Stylus to CSS
- modularize datepicker or remove jQuery UI dependency
- Remove last 3rd party dependency

### v0.6.0
- AngularJS v1.3 support

### v0.7.0+
- Convert to Javascript
- Rewrite/refactor
